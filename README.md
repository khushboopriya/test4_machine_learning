# test4_machine_learning

STEPS:
1. Data cleaning, since the data didn't had any null values so not removed.
2. I have used logistic regression had binary values to  be predicted .
3. I have also applied random forest model on the dataset, the random forest had more accuracy than the logistic regression model.
